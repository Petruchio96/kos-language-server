# KOS Atom Client

This is the initial release of the atom client for the kos-language-server. Current this package only includes syntax highlighting for the Kerboscript language.

In the future the language server will be connected to this package. Eventually you will need to install atom-ide-ui for full supoort using the following command.

    apm install atom-ide-ui
