               Alarms, meanings and ordering
               -----------------------------

          000 - No alarm present, 000 covers up the previous alarm if it has been resolved.

Alarms starting with 0 followed by two numbers indicate that there is an issue on the surface, this may vary from being on the launchpad
to being landed on a planet.

          001 - Launch clamps have been found in stages other than the current stage.
          002 - No engine in first stage.

Alarms starting with 1 followed by two numbers indicate that there is an issue while in flight.

          101 - Dry mass has decreased although no staging has occurred, activates run mode 998.
          102 - Vertical velocity under 0 m/s during ascent, activates run mode 998.

Alarms starting with 2 followed by two numbers indicate that there is an issue with resources on the ship.

          201 - Low electric charge.
          202 - Low on liquid fuel.
          203 - Low on mono propellant.

Alarms starting with 3 followed by two numbers indicate that there is an issue with rendezvous and/or docking.

          301 - Rendezvous burn is in or below atmosphere.
          302 - Approaching target too fast, slow down.


Alarms starting with 9 followed by two numbers indicate that there is an issue in the script (faulty results), this can occur at any time.

          901 - Target height is too low for a stable orbit due to a present atmosphere and error margin.
          902 - Target height is below the surface or too close to the surface (for bodies without atmosphere).
          903 - Target height exceeds the sphere of influence of current planet.
          904 - Essential parts not tagged.
          905 - Tags not tagged to the correct part.
          906 - User activated alarm, activates run mode 998.




          --------------------------------
          Run modes, meanings and ordering
          --------------------------------

Run modes are like checkpoints for scripts, if a run mode is set and the the program ends it can pick up from where it was by checking
which run mode was set.
          000 - pre-flight checks.
          001 - gravity turn
          002 - circularizing
          998 - auto abort system, immediately fires LES, throttles down to 0 and stages till the parachute stage (and deploys them later).
          999 - If a  "standard" error occurs it gets set to this run mode, although harmful to the script it does not require auto abort. .
